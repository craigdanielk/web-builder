# Animation Extraction & Integration Plan

This plan covers the implementation of an animation extraction system for the web-builder project. The system will analyze reference websites to extract CSS animations, transitions, scroll-triggered effects, and interactive patterns, then integrate them into generated website builds. This enables builds to include polished motion design derived from real-world inspiration sites rather than relying solely on static templates.
