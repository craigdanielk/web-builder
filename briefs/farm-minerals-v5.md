# Brief: farm-minerals-v5

## Business
Farm Minerals manufactures and distributes advanced agricultural fertilizers using proprietary nano-scale mineral technology. Their flagship product, CropTab™, is a tablet-format fertilizer system that claims to deliver the same yield as traditional bulk fertilizers while dramatically reducing application rates, logistics weight, and carbon emissions. The company positions itself as a climate-conscious alternative to conventional agriculture inputs, emphasizing zero manufacturing emissions, near-total nutrient uptake (99%), and elimination of agricultural runoff. They appear to be in an early commercial phase with ongoing field trials and controlled product access.

## What They Need
This is a promotional/product landing page designed to generate qualified leads for their CropTab™ fertilizer system during what appears to be a limited beta or early-access phase. The site needs to educate farmers and agricultural decision-makers about the technology's environmental and economic benefits while capturing interest through access requests and sample distribution. It serves as both a sales tool and a credibility-builder during active field trials.

## Key Requirements
- Hero section with clear product value proposition focused on efficiency and waste reduction
- Technology explanation section breaking down the innovation (nano-scale particles, integration mechanism, zero emissions manufacturing)
- Product showcase for the CropTab™ line with distinct SKUs (NPK, K, N, P, NPK+)
- Environmental impact metrics prominently displayed (1000x lighter logistics, ½ ton CO₂e saved per acre, 99% uptake, 0 run-off)
- Social proof section for field testing results and farmer testimonials
- Transparent field trial updates section showing real-time testing progress
- Multiple conversion paths: access requests, sample requests, eligibility checks, direct contact
- Product category navigation (Macronutrient Fertilizers, Micronutrient Fertilizers, Feed Additives)
- Supporting product lines (Nutripeak™ Micros, ElevateFeed™)
- Educational content links to deeper science and approach pages
- Clear differentiation between tablet formats and application methods

## Target Audience
- Commercial farmers and farm operators looking to reduce input costs and logistics complexity
- Agricultural sustainability managers at large farming operations
- Early adopters in the regenerative agriculture movement
- Farm decision-makers motivated by carbon reduction and environmental compliance
- Agricultural consultants and agronomists evaluating new input technologies
- Grant-funded or climate-focused farming operations

## Brand Personality
- Scientific but accessible — uses precise metrics and technical language without becoming academic
- Provocative and challenging — questions conventional farming waste ("How much could you grow — if nothing was wasted?")
- Transparent and collaborative — openly shares field trial progress and testing timelines
- Mission-driven but pragmatic — leads with environmental benefits but emphasizes maintained yields
- Confident innovator — positions technology as fundamentally reinventing delivery systems
- Insider/exclusive tone — "You don't get many chances to be early" suggests limited opportunity

## Specific Requests
- Maintain the visual hierarchy that leads with a philosophical question before explaining the product
- Preserve the modular content structure that separates technology benefits (nano-scale, integration, emissions) from practical benefits (logistics, uptake, CO₂ savings)
- Keep the transparent "Field Trials in Progress" section with update timelines as a trust signal
- Multiple "Request Access" CTAs throughout the page that suggest controlled distribution
- Side-by-side product comparison capability for different CropTab™ formulations
- Metrics need to be large, scannable, and prominently featured (the ½ ton CO₂e, 99% uptake, 1000x lighter stats)
- "Just drop it" simplicity messaging for application method
- Preserve the progression from problem → solution → product → proof → action

## Technical Notes
- Next.js 14+ with App Router
- Several CTAs link to anchor tags (#) suggesting modal or slide-out forms for access requests rather than separate pages
- Need form handling for: general contact, access requests, eligibility checks, sample requests
- Product navigation system that can accommodate expanding SKU list (NPK, K, N, P, NPK+ already exist)
- Content structure should support A/B testing of messaging (currently testing different value props)
- Consider headless CMS integration for field trial updates section (mentions "Next update" timeline)
- High-quality product imagery required for tablet visualization
- Performance optimization critical for agricultural audiences who may have limited rural connectivity
- Should accommodate future expansion into Feed Additives and other product categories beyond fertilizers
