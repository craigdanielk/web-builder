# Brief: farm-minerals-anim

## Business
Farm Minerals develops and manufactures advanced agricultural fertilizers using novel nanotechnology delivery systems. Their flagship product, CropTab™, is a tablet-based fertilizer that claims to achieve higher nutrient uptake rates (99%), zero runoff, and significant carbon emissions reduction compared to traditional bulk fertilizers. The company positions itself as a climate-focused agricultural innovation company, emphasizing sustainability metrics like 1000x lighter logistics and ½ ton CO₂e saved per acre. They're currently in field trial phase and operating on a limited-access model for early adopters.

## What They Need
A product landing page that educates farmers and agricultural decision-makers about CropTab™'s revolutionary approach to fertilizer delivery while building urgency around early access to field trials. The site needs to convert technically-minded farmers by presenting hard data on efficiency gains and environmental impact, while maintaining momentum around product availability and trial participation.

## Key Requirements
- Hero section with aspirational headline questioning current farming waste
- Three-part value proposition showcase: particle size technology, integration ease, zero emissions manufacturing
- Product introduction section with visual demonstration of tablet application ("Just drop it")
- Four key benefit callouts: delivery reinvention, zero runoff, zero emissions, precision uptake
- Social proof section featuring farmer testimonials and field test results
- Environmental impact calculator/metrics dashboard showing CO₂ savings, logistics weight reduction, and uptake efficiency
- Live field trial status section with progress updates and transparency messaging
- Multiple access request/eligibility check CTAs throughout the page
- Product variant showcase for different CropTab™ formulations (NPK, K, N, P, NPK+)
- Product category navigation for Macronutrient Fertilizers, Micronutrient Fertilizers, and Feed Additives
- Secondary product line mentions (Nutripeak™ Micros, ElevateFeed™)

## Target Audience
- Commercial row crop farmers managing 500+ acres looking to reduce input costs
- Agricultural operations managers focused on sustainability metrics and ESG reporting
- Early-adopter farmers interested in precision agriculture and novel farming technologies
- Agronomists and crop consultants evaluating new fertilizer technologies for client recommendations
- Agricultural sustainability officers at large farming operations or co-ops

## Brand Personality
- Scientifically rigorous but approachable — using specific metrics (99% uptake, ½ ton CO₂e) without being academic
- Transparently innovative — openly sharing field trial progress and admitting they're still testing
- Environmentally urgent — leading with planetary impact without greenwashing language
- Farmer-centric pragmatism — emphasizing "less in, same out" economic efficiency over purely environmental benefits
- Understated confidence — using rhetorical questions and invitation-based CTAs rather than aggressive selling

## Specific Requests
- Preserve the rhetorical question-based headline structure ("How much could you grow — if nothing was wasted?")
- Maintain the side-by-side benefit presentation format (particle size / integration / emissions)
- Keep the minimalist "Just drop it" application messaging that emphasizes simplicity
- Retain the specific quantified claims framework: "1000x lighter logistics," "½ ton of CO₂e saved per acre," "99% uptake path"
- Preserve the "Field Trials in Progress" transparency section with update timeline
- Keep the "You don't get many chances to be early" scarcity/urgency positioning
- Maintain multiple access gate CTAs (request access, check eligibility, request sample) with different entry points
- Preserve the distinction between macro/micro fertilizer categories and feed additive products

## Technical Notes
- Standard Next.js build with TypeScript
- Multiple modal/overlay triggers for access requests, eligibility checks, and sample requests (currently linking to #)
- Product filtering or tabbed navigation system for fertilizer variants (NPK, K, N, P, NPK+)
- Consider implementing actual eligibility form or waitlist system (currently placeholder links)
- Image optimization required for product variant visuals
- Consider scroll-triggered animations for environmental metrics to emphasize impact numbers
- Implement field trial progress tracker that can be updated without full deployments
- Mobile-first design critical given agricultural/field-based audience
- Performance optimization important for rural internet connectivity scenarios
