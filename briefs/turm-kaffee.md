# Brief: Turm Kaffee

## Business
Turm Kaffee is a specialty coffee roaster based in Zurich, Switzerland.
They source single-origin beans through direct trade relationships with
farmers in Ethiopia, Colombia, and Guatemala.

## What They Need
A marketing website that communicates their craft, tells their sourcing
story, showcases their products, and drives online sales through a
subscription model.

## Key Requirements
- Subscription service is a primary revenue driver (weekly and monthly plans)
- The sourcing/direct-trade story is a key differentiator — must be prominent
- Product range: 6-8 single-origin beans, each with unique origin story
- Photography is strong — they have professional shots of their roastery,
  farming partners, and products
- Currently migrating from Magento to Shopify (this site is the new storefront)

## Target Audience
- Coffee enthusiasts aged 25-45
- Urban professionals in Zurich and across Switzerland
- People who care about ethical sourcing and quality
- Existing subscription customers who need a better online experience

## Brand Personality
- Warm but not folksy
- Knowledgeable but not pretentious
- Swiss precision meets artisan craft
- "We take coffee seriously so you can enjoy it simply"

## Specific Requests
- Dark, moody hero with their roastery photography
- The bean sourcing journey should feel like a story, not a feature list
- Subscription pricing should be clear and simple
- Newsletter signup for roasting tips and new bean announcements
- Keep it clean — they don't want it to feel cluttered

## Technical Notes
- Shopify storefront (Hydrogen/custom theme)
- Must be fast — they care about performance
- Multi-language consideration (German/English) for future
