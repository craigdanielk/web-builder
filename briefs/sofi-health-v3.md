# Brief: sofi-health-v3

## Business
Sofi Health is a digital health company that combines plant-based remedies with smart technology to help people improve sleep and mood. They've created a connected spray device (the "sofi pod") that works with replaceable plant-based capsules and a companion mobile app. The system uses data tracking to personalize which plant formulations work best for each individual user. Their approach bridges traditional herbal remedies (valerian, passiflora, ashwagandha) with modern data science to measure and optimize personal wellness outcomes.

## What They Need
A marketing website that serves as the primary brand introduction and education platform, explaining the sofi ecosystem (pod hardware, plant capsules, and app) while driving users to the e-commerce platform. The site needs to communicate a complex three-part product system in a simple, approachable way and convert visitors into customers through the "shop sofi" portal.

## Key Requirements
- Hero section with bold brand statement establishing the plant-science positioning
- Detailed product showcase for the sofi pod hardware (features: week-long battery, USB-C charging, Bluetooth connectivity, lock technology, color options in black/white)
- Plant capsule catalog featuring individual formulations with descriptions (currently: valerian, passiflora, ashwagandha)
- Explanation of the data/measurement system showing how the pod tracks usage and the app identifies personal responses
- Social proof through quantitative results (2.12x sleep improvement metric, 37 plants referenced)
- Information about the two product types: oral sprays (10-day impact) and functional fragrances (instant mood boost)
- Scientific credibility section covering research methodology, herbalist partnerships, and sustainability
- Mobile app feature descriptions for both Android and iOS
- Pioneer program/early access signup pathway for new plant formulations
- Clear navigation funnel to the separate e-commerce site (sofi.health)

## Target Audience
- Health-conscious millennials and Gen Z seeking natural alternatives to pharmaceutical sleep aids
- Tech-forward wellness enthusiasts who appreciate data-driven personalization
- People experiencing sleep issues or mood challenges looking for non-pharmaceutical solutions
- Early adopters interested in connected health devices and quantified-self tracking
- Consumers skeptical of "one-size-fits-all" remedies who want personalized solutions

## Brand Personality
- Scientific yet accessible - balancing research credibility with approachable language
- Minimal and modern - clean design aesthetic, simple color palette (black/white), pocket-sized discretion
- Discovery-oriented - language like "sofi" as a verb, "personal playlist," "unique discoveries"
- Collaborative and supportive - "we work together," community emphasis, "never sofi alone"
- Nature-meets-technology - traditional plant wisdom enhanced by modern data science

## Specific Requests
- Maintain the distinctive "feelbetter" single-word heading treatment as the emotional anchor
- Preserve the modular product education approach that breaks down the pod into discrete benefits (long life, personal + portable, connected, black or white)
- Keep the three-stage explanation framework: individual tracking → learning from data → measurement/results
- Retain the seasonal plant release model messaging and pioneer program exclusivity
- Maintain the metric-driven results presentation (the 2.12x sleep improvement stat is key social proof)
- Preserve the "nature's magic" / "sofi capsules" section structure for introducing plant formulations
- Keep the dual-product explanation (spray-to-swallow vs functional fragrance formats)
- Ensure the sustainability and scientific rigor messaging (herbalists, conservationists, botanic gardens, paper reviews)

## Technical Notes
- Standard Next.js build with optimized image loading for multiple product and lifestyle images
- Need seamless external linking to separate e-commerce domain (sofi.health) without breaking user flow
- Mobile-first responsive design critical given the smartphone app dependency
- Consider animations/micro-interactions for the "connected device" sections to reinforce the tech aspect
- App store badge integration for iOS and Android download links
- Performance optimization essential for the visual-heavy product showcase sections
- Potential integration points for community features mentioned in body copy
