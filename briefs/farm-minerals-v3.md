# Brief: farm-minerals-v3

## Business
Farm Minerals is an agricultural technology company developing advanced mineral fertilizer products delivered in compact tablet form. Their flagship product, CropTab™, represents a revolutionary approach to crop nutrition that drastically reduces waste, eliminates runoff, and cuts carbon emissions compared to traditional bulk fertilizers. The company positions itself at the intersection of agricultural innovation and environmental sustainability, offering products that maintain yields while reducing inputs by leveraging nano-scale particles and precision uptake technology. They're currently in field trial stages with select farmers while building market awareness.

## What They Need
This is a product launch and lead generation website designed to create early adopter interest in CropTab™ technology. The site needs to educate sophisticated agricultural buyers (commercial farmers, ag consultants) on a fundamentally new fertilizer delivery system, establish credibility through science-backed claims and field trial transparency, and capture qualified leads through eligibility checks and access requests. The primary conversion goal is getting prospects to request samples or contact the sales team.

## Key Requirements
- Hero section with compelling value proposition focused on waste elimination and efficiency gains
- Product differentiation section explaining the technology advantages (nano-scale particles, integrative properties, zero emissions manufacturing)
- Feature showcase for CropTab™ highlighting ease of use ("Just drop it"), delivery innovation, zero runoff, and emissions benefits
- Social proof section with farmer testimonials and field test results
- Environmental impact metrics prominently displayed (1000x lighter logistics, ½ ton CO₂e saved per acre, 99% uptake)
- Active field trials section with transparency about testing progress and next update timelines
- Product catalog showing different CropTab™ formulations (NPK, K, N, P, NPK+) and other product lines (Nutripeak™ Micros, ElevateFeed™)
- Multiple conversion paths: eligibility checker, sample requests, contact forms, and access requests
- Educational content links to deeper science pages and approach documentation
- Clear messaging around exclusive early access and limited availability positioning

## Target Audience
- Commercial farmers and large-scale agricultural operations seeking to reduce input costs and environmental impact
- Progressive/early adopter farmers interested in precision agriculture and sustainable practices
- Agricultural consultants and agronomists evaluating new fertilizer technologies
- Sustainability-focused agricultural businesses looking to reduce their carbon footprint
- Farm operations managers making purchasing decisions for large acreage

## Brand Personality
- Scientifically rigorous yet accessible — uses precise metrics and technical language without alienating practical farmers
- Transparently innovative — openly shares field trial progress and acknowledges testing phase rather than overselling
- Environmentally responsible without being preachy — leads with efficiency and cost benefits, environmental gains follow naturally
- Confident but not arrogant — positions as revolutionary while respecting farmers' intelligence and experience
- Pragmatic optimism — focuses on measurable outcomes (yield maintenance, input reduction, emissions savings) rather than abstract sustainability claims

## Specific Requests
- Maintain the provocative opening question format: "How much could you grow — if nothing was wasted?"
- Preserve the visual product showcase with individual CropTab™ variant cards showing different formulations
- Keep the quantified environmental impact statistics as hero numbers (1000x, ½ ton, 99%)
- Retain the "Field Trials in Progress" transparency section with update timeline — this builds credibility
- Maintain multiple product categories visible in navigation (Macronutrient Fertilizers, Micronutrient Fertilizers, Feed Additives)
- Keep the "You don't get many chances to be early" scarcity messaging for the access request flow
- Preserve the dual-track CTAs: some for immediate contact, others for checking eligibility (implies selective access)
- Maintain educational content architecture with links to deeper science and approach pages

## Technical Notes
- Build on Next.js with TypeScript
- Several CTAs currently point to anchor links on the same page (#) — these need to be connected to actual eligibility checker and request access modal/form flows
- Need form integration for: eligibility checker, sample requests, and access requests (separate from general contact form)
- Consider headless CMS for field trial updates and testimonial management
- Image optimization critical for product photography and potentially chart/data visualizations
- May need conditional content display based on product availability or trial phase
- Analytics tracking essential for conversion funnel analysis (eligibility checks → sample requests → contact)
- Mobile-first approach crucial as farmers often research on phones in field settings
