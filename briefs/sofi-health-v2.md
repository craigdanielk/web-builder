# Brief: sofi-health-v2

## Business
sofi is a wellness technology company that combines plant-based remedies with digital health tracking. They've created a connected spray device (the "sofi pod") that works with replaceable plant capsules (valerian, passiflora, ashwagandha) to deliver natural wellness solutions for sleep and mood improvement. The business bridges traditional herbal medicine with modern data science, measuring individual responses to plant formulations through their app. They appear to be direct-to-consumer with an e-commerce focus, emphasizing personalization through ongoing use and data collection.

## What They Need
A product showcase and education website that explains the sofi system (pod + capsules + app) and drives users to their shop. The site needs to position sofi as a scientifically-backed, design-forward alternative to traditional supplements, while explaining a relatively novel product concept that requires user understanding before purchase. Primary goal is conversion to shop, secondary goal is education about how the system works and the science behind it.

## Key Requirements
- Hero section with bold, minimal messaging emphasizing the "feel better" benefit
- Detailed product showcase for the sofi pod with specific features (battery life, portability, connectivity, color options)
- Plant capsule library with individual profiles for each formulation (valerian, passiflora, ashwagandha)
- Explanation of the data/measurement system and how sofi learns from user behavior
- Display of efficacy metrics (the "2.12x sleep improvement" stat and similar data points)
- Information about the science and sourcing (research papers, herbalists, conservationists, botanic gardens)
- Pioneer program signup promotion for early access to new formulations
- App features and benefits section (iOS and Android availability)
- E-commerce integration/links to shop (currently linking to sofi.health domain)
- Visual product photography showing device in black and white finishes
- Seasonal new product releases messaging

## Target Audience
- Health-conscious millennials and Gen Z (25-40) seeking natural alternatives to pharmaceutical sleep aids
- Early adopters interested in connected wellness devices and self-tracking
- People experiencing sleep issues or anxiety looking for non-pharmaceutical solutions
- Tech-savvy consumers who appreciate app-integrated products
- Design-conscious consumers who value aesthetics alongside functionality
- Individuals interested in personalized health solutions based on data

## Brand Personality
- Scientific but approachable — grounded in research without being clinical
- Minimalist and design-forward — clean, modern aesthetic with premium positioning
- Curious and discovery-oriented — language around "discoveries," "learning," "identifying"
- Patient and process-focused — emphasis on "over time," "10 days," ongoing measurement
- Warm and human — "feel better," "your favourite plants," community-oriented
- Innovative yet rooted in tradition — "thousands of years" meets digital technology

## Specific Requests
- Maintain the ultra-minimal typographic approach with the "feelbetter" one-word hero treatment
- Preserve the modular section layout with alternating product details (battery life, portability, connectivity, colors)
- Keep the clean product photography style showing the pod in slate and white finishes
- Retain the data visualization approach for efficacy metrics (the "2.12x" callout format)
- Maintain the capsule showcase with individual plant profiles and imagery
- Preserve the seasonal release messaging and pioneer program promotion
- Keep the three-part value proposition structure: pod features, plant science, data measurement
- Maintain focus on the "digital bridge" concept between physical product and app intelligence

## Technical Notes
- Build on Next.js with performance optimization for image-heavy product showcase
- Implement smooth scroll animations for section transitions (appears to be intended design pattern)
- Bluetooth connectivity information suggests some users may arrive on mobile — ensure mobile-first responsive design
- E-commerce functionality links to separate shop domain (sofi.health vs sofihealth.com) — clarify integration approach
- App download CTAs should detect platform and direct to appropriate store (iOS/Android)
- Consider headless CMS for plant capsule library to support "new plants every season" content strategy
- Analytics integration essential given the data-driven brand positioning — track scroll depth, section engagement, shop click-through rates
