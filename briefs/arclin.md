# Brief: Arclin Website Rebuild

## Business
Arclin is a materials technology manufacturer with 50+ years of experience producing engineered building solutions and performance polymers. They supply critical materials across diverse industries including construction, pharmaceuticals, water treatment, agriculture, energy & mining, and automotive. The company operates multiple brands (11 total) including Arclync, Trade Fabrication Systems, and Firepoint, offering 14+ product types ranging from concrete forming overlays and decorative surface films to peptide coupling agents. They position themselves as an innovation-driven partner rather than a commodity supplier, with a strong commitment to sustainability (95%+ emissions reduction) and community impact.

## What They Need
A product-focused website that serves as both a comprehensive catalog and lead generation engine. The site must help diverse B2B customers discover the right materials for their specific applications while positioning Arclin as a hands-on technical partner. The primary conversion goal is driving qualified inquiries through the "Get Started" form for custom product solutions.

## Key Requirements
- Multi-faceted product browsing system with three filtering approaches: by product type (14 categories), by brand (11 brands), and by industry application (10+ industries)
- Detailed product repository showcasing both engineered building solutions and performance polymers
- Prominent "Get Started" CTA appearing multiple times throughout the homepage with direct path to custom consultation request
- Content sections highlighting four key differentiators: material durability/quality, innovation/R&D capabilities, hands-on partnership approach, and sustainability commitment
- Dedicated pages or sections for: About/Company story, Sustainability initiatives, Community impact, and Products catalog
- "Our impact is all around" messaging that connects products to everyday applications (homes, cars, food, water, pharmaceuticals)
- Brand showcase featuring subsidiary brands with their collective 100+ years of experience
- Clear segmentation between the two main product divisions: Engineered Building Solutions and Performance Polymers

## Target Audience
- Manufacturing procurement managers and engineers seeking specialty materials for construction, industrial, or pharmaceutical applications
- Product developers and R&D teams in industries like building materials, water treatment, agriculture, and pharmaceuticals who need technical partnership and custom solutions
- OEM decision-makers looking for differentiated materials that improve product performance and competitive positioning
- Sustainability-focused buyers evaluating suppliers based on environmental practices and emissions reduction

## Brand Personality
- Reliable and mission-critical: "vital beyond measure," "products that can't fail," "peace of mind"
- Collaborative and consultative: "hands-on partner (not just another supplier)," "work side-by-side," "solve complex problems"
- Innovation-driven: "cutting-edge technologies," "rapidly changing world," "market trends"
- Quality-focused with technical credibility: "industry-leading," "testing and improving," "exceed regulatory demands"
- Purpose-driven: "better tomorrow," "leave the world better," "uplift our community"

## Specific Requests
- Maintain the three-tab product browsing interface (Product Type / Brand / Industry) with visible count indicators (e.g., "14 types," "11 brands," "10 industries")
- Preserve the storytelling approach that connects technical products to everyday life impact rather than leading with dry specifications
- Keep the emphasis on partnership and consultation over transactional sales—every product discovery path should lead to expert consultation
- Maintain the balance between two distinct product lines (building solutions vs. performance polymers) without favoring one over the other
- Include the sustainability timeline narrative (20+ years of emissions reduction technology)
- Feature the diverse industry applications prominently—this breadth is a key differentiator

## Technical Notes
- Standard Next.js build with TypeScript
- Product catalog system needs robust filtering and categorization—potentially headless CMS (Contentful or Sanity) for managing 14+ product types across 11 brands and 10+ industries
- Form integration for "Get Started" lead capture with likely CRM connection
- Consider product search functionality given the large catalog scope
- Mobile optimization critical for field engineers and on-site decision makers
- Fast page loads essential given technical/industrial audience expectations
- Accessibility compliance for enterprise procurement standards
