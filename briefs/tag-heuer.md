# Brief: TAG Heuer

## Business
TAG Heuer is a Swiss luxury watchmaker founded in 1860, now a brand of LVMH Swiss Manufactures SA. They are synonymous with Swiss avant-garde watchmaking — blending traditional haute horlogerie with motorsport heritage and modern technology. Their collections include the iconic Carrera (motorsport-inspired), Formula 1 (racing/entry luxury), Aquaracer (diving), Monaco (square case, Steve McQueen legacy), Connected (smartwatch), and Link (daily luxury). They also produce luxury eyewear. The brand's philosophy is captured by Jack Heuer's quote: "Time never stops, why should we?" — a commitment to perpetual innovation within Swiss precision.

## What They Need
A brand-forward homepage that establishes TAG Heuer's heritage, showcases their watch collections, and drives visitors to explore individual product lines or find a store. The page should communicate Swiss precision, motorsport DNA, and avant-garde design. It needs to serve both collectors familiar with the brand and aspirational buyers discovering TAG Heuer for the first time. The primary conversion paths are: browse collections, find a store, and subscribe to the newsletter.

## Key Requirements
- Cinematic hero section featuring the brand founder Jack Heuer with his signature quote — establishes heritage and authority immediately
- Collection showcase section with the 6 major watch lines (Carrera, Formula 1, Aquaracer, Monaco, Connected, Link) — each as a visually distinct card/tile with collection imagery
- Brand heritage section — "Swiss avant-garde since 1860" positioning with key milestones or brand philosophy
- Product detail spotlight — one hero product (e.g., latest Carrera release) with dramatic macro photography showing movement, case finish, and dial detail
- Craftsmanship / Savoir-Faire section — Swiss manufacturing, in-house movements, materials (titanium, ceramic, sapphire crystal)
- Motorsport heritage section — the TAG Heuer Formula 1 connection, racing partnerships, chronograph DNA
- Store locator CTA — "Find the nearest store" prominently placed
- Newsletter subscription — clean, minimal signup
- Social media links (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, Pinterest, YouTube, Twitter, Weibo, WeChat, Line) — reflecting global luxury brand presence
- Support/service section — warranty, online services, size guide, FAQ
- Legal footer with LVMH Swiss Manufactures SA attribution

## Target Audience
- Luxury watch collectors and enthusiasts (primary — high purchase intent)
- Aspirational buyers aged 25-40 considering their first luxury timepiece
- Motorsport fans drawn to TAG Heuer's racing heritage
- Tech-forward consumers interested in the Connected smartwatch line
- Gift buyers seeking a prestigious, recognizable luxury brand
- International clientele (multi-language, multi-region — the site serves CH/en specifically)

## Brand Personality
- Swiss precision — meticulous, exact, quality-obsessed
- Avant-garde — pushing boundaries while respecting tradition
- Heritage-rich — 165+ years of watchmaking, founder-driven story
- Motorsport DNA — speed, performance, competition, adrenaline
- Confident luxury — never shouts, never discounts, lets the product speak
- Masculine-leaning but inclusive — traditionally male-oriented but modern collections are unisex

## Specific Requests
- Dark/black primary background — luxury watches are always presented on dark backgrounds for maximum visual drama
- Gold/amber accent color for highlights, CTAs, and typographic details — evokes precious metals and luxury
- The Jack Heuer signature and quote should be a visual centerpiece — possibly with a signature-style script element
- Collection cards should use full-bleed product photography with minimal text overlay — let the watches be the heroes
- Typography should pair a refined serif for headings (heritage feel) with a clean sans-serif for body (modern precision)
- Generous whitespace between sections — the "breathing room" signals luxury (never cramped or information-dense)
- Sharp/minimal border radius — luxury watch brands use angular, precise design language, not rounded/soft shapes
- Hover effects on collection cards should be subtle and elegant — slight scale, not bouncy or playful
- The motorsport connection should be visually referenced (not just stated) — consider racing stripe accents, chronograph imagery, or speed-related motion design
- Navigation should include collection quick-links, search, account, and cart (standard luxury e-commerce nav)
- Footer structured with 4 columns: Collections, Maison, Support, Privacy & Terms
- Include LVMH attribution: "© TAG Heuer Brand of LVMH Swiss Manufactures SA - 2026"

## Technical Notes
- React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Next.js
- GSAP + ScrollTrigger for dramatic product reveals — watches should emerge from shadow with scroll-triggered lighting effects
- Dark theme throughout — requires careful text contrast management (neutral-200 on neutral-950 minimum)
- Macro product photography is essential to this brand — gradients alone won't convey luxury. If extraction captures real assets, prioritize hero product shots
- Reference URL: https://www.tagheuer.com/ch/en/
- Fonts: Playfair Display (headings, heritage serif) + Inter (body, modern precision sans-serif) — matches jewelry-watches preset
- Multi-language awareness: the site operates in English, French, Spanish, and Chinese — design should accommodate varying text lengths
- The original site uses region/language selection as a gateway — consider a region selector in nav or as an entry modal
- Product imagery needs to be extremely high quality — low-res watch photography destroys luxury credibility instantly
- Consider subtle particle or light-leak effects on the hero section to add cinematic depth
- The original site is relatively minimal in content (more of a gateway to collections) — expand with heritage/craftsmanship content to create a richer marketing page
