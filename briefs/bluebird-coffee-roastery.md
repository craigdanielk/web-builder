# Brief: Bluebird Coffee Roastery

## Business
Bluebird Coffee Roastery is a specialty-grade coffee roaster based in Howick,
KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. They roast single-origin coffees from Ethiopia,
Kenya, Colombia, and Guatemala alongside house blends, and sell direct-to-consumer
via subscriptions and their online shop. They also operate a café at 11 on
Karklood, Howick, and produce the podcast "Coffee Made Me Do It."

## What They Need
A full marketing homepage that positions Bluebird as South Africa's go-to
specialty roaster, showcases their single-origin coffees and subscription
offerings, drives online sales, and invites visitors to the Howick café.
This is a rebuild of their existing WooCommerce storefront with a modern,
elevated design language.

## Key Requirements
- Hero must establish specialty-grade positioning and the "roasted for home
  brewing" promise — warm, inviting, not pretentious
- Product showcase featuring single origins (Ethiopia, Kenya, Colombia,
  Guatemala) and house blends (The Friendly Blend, Dreamer) with origin
  stories and tasting notes
- Subscription section highlighting all five tiers:
  - Curated Coffee Subscription (new monthly selections)
  - Best of Bluebird (rare exclusive releases, from R349/month)
  - House Blend Subscription (regular espresso blends)
  - Gift Coffee Subscription (3–12 month gifting)
  - Coffee Pod Subscription (30 compostable pods monthly)
- Social proof — 4.9-star rating across 99 reviews, customer testimonials
  about quality and home brewing success
- About section telling the Bluebird story — craft roasting in KZN,
  transparent sourcing, specialty-grade commitment
- How-it-works or process section showing the journey from sourcing to
  roasting to home delivery
- Free shipping callout (orders over R699)
- Café/roastery location section with address (11 on Karklood, Howick,
  KZN 3290), contact numbers (Roastery: +27 82 306 1935, Café: 078 009 6906),
  and email (dario@bluebirdcoffeeroastery.co.za)
- Newsletter signup for coffee news and exclusive offers
- Footer with social links, shop categories, legal links

## Target Audience
- South African coffee enthusiasts upgrading from commercial to specialty
- Home brewers looking for freshly roasted beans delivered monthly
- Gift shoppers seeking quality coffee subscriptions
- Howick and KZN locals looking for a specialty café experience
- Wholesale buyers — restaurants, offices, and retailers

## Brand Personality
- Approachable and passionate — specialty without the snobbery
- Craft-focused and transparent about sourcing
- South African proud — rooted in KZN, serving the whole country
- Warm, friendly, community-driven ("The Friendly Blend" energy)
- Knowledgeable but never intimidating

## Specific Requests
- Adapt the artisan-food warm-earth palette to incorporate Bluebird's teal/blue
  brand identity (#45708a) as the accent color, with cream (#f4ead8) backgrounds
  instead of stone — the result should feel warm but distinctly Bluebird
- Hero should use dark, moody coffee photography with warm highlights — beans,
  crema, roasting process, not sterile product shots
- Product cards should show origin country, roast level, flavor notes (the site
  uses emoji-style flavor descriptors — keep that energy)
- Subscription section should feel inviting and easy to compare, not overwhelming
  — five tiers is a lot, so visual hierarchy matters
- The café section should feel like an invitation to visit, with the Howick
  location featured prominently
- Overall feel: craft authenticity, South African warmth, teal accent pops
  against earthy cream backgrounds
- Include a marquee/ticker or logo bar celebrating key values: "Specialty Grade",
  "Transparently Traded", "Freshly Roasted", "Free Shipping R699+",
  "Compostable Pods"

## Technical Notes
- WooCommerce storefront (existing — this is a frontend marketing page rebuild)
- Currency: ZAR (South African Rand)
- Must be responsive and fast on mobile (large SA mobile audience)
- Price range: Individual coffees R239–R1299, subscriptions from R159/month
- Gift cards available in R250, R500, R1000 denominations
- Podcast integration consideration ("Coffee Made Me Do It")
