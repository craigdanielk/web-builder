# Brief: nicola-romei

## Business
Nicola Romei is a Digital Experience Designer and Awwwards Judge operating as an independent creative professional. He specializes in creating immersive, visually-driven websites with sophisticated motion design and a distinctive aesthetic signature. His work has earned recognition from Awwwards, positioning him as a premium-tier designer in the digital experience space.

## What They Need
A portfolio website that serves as both a showcase and an interactive design artifact in itself. The site needs to function as "the artboard™" — a curated, structured environment where design work, systems, and research are organized and continuously revisited. The portfolio must demonstrate the designer's capabilities through its own execution, acting as a primary business development tool for attracting high-end clients and collaborators.

## Key Requirements
- Interactive artboard interface with scroll/drag functionality that serves as the primary navigation
- Grid-based archive system for organizing and displaying past work and design research
- Profile section showcasing credentials, experience, and expertise
- Direct integration with external validation (Awwwards profile, LinkedIn)
- Email contact system with pre-populated subject lines for project inquiries
- Strong visual hierarchy emphasizing the "artboard" concept as the core metaphor
- Portfolio pieces organized in a way that allows continuous revisiting and exploration
- Navigation that supports both structured browsing (archive, profile) and free exploration (grid interaction)

## Target Audience
- Creative directors and brand managers at premium agencies seeking high-caliber digital design expertise
- Tech companies and startups looking to elevate their digital presence with award-worthy design
- Fellow designers and Awwwards community members evaluating work and seeking collaboration
- Potential clients who value sophisticated motion design, strong visual direction, and design innovation over standard templates

## Brand Personality
- Sophisticated and conceptually-driven (evidenced by "the artboard™" trademark and philosophical framing)
- Technically accomplished with attention to craft (emphasis on "refined motion" and "distinct design signature")
- Structured yet experimental (organized archive paired with interactive exploration)
- Confident and established (Awwwards Judge credentials, trademark branding)
- Minimal and direct in communication style (uppercase labels, concise copy, focused messaging)

## Specific Requests
- Preserve the "artboard™" trademarked concept as the central organizing metaphor and brand identity
- Maintain the dual navigation approach: interactive grid exploration AND structured menu access
- Keep the scroll/drag interaction as the primary engagement mechanism for the artboard
- Preserve the uppercase typographic treatment for navigation and structural labels
- Maintain the archival/preservation language that frames work as "accumulated over time" and "continuously revisited"
- Ensure the site itself demonstrates the design quality and motion sophistication described in the value proposition
- Keep direct links to social proof (Awwwards) and professional network (LinkedIn) prominently accessible

## Technical Notes
- Build on Next.js for performance and SEO optimization
- Implement custom scroll/drag interaction system for the artboard interface
- Ensure smooth, performant animations that showcase motion design capabilities
- Grid system must be responsive while maintaining design integrity
- Consider WebGL or canvas-based approach for the interactive artboard if appropriate for the design vision
- Optimize for fast initial load while supporting rich interactive elements
- Implement proper route handling for archive and profile deep links
- Email integration with pre-populated subject lines for contact CTA
