# Brief: farm-minerals-v4

## Business
Farm Minerals manufactures advanced agricultural fertilizers using a revolutionary nano-particle tablet delivery system. Their flagship product, CropTab™, replaces traditional bulk fertilizers with compact tablets that claim 99% uptake efficiency, zero runoff, and significantly reduced carbon emissions. The company is positioning itself as a climate-tech solution for industrial agriculture, currently in field trial phase with farmers. They appear to be in growth/pre-launch mode, actively recruiting early adopter farmers for testing programs.

## What They Need
A conversion-focused landing page that educates farmers and agricultural decision-makers about CropTab™ technology while capturing qualified leads for their field trial program. The site needs to clearly communicate the environmental and economic benefits of switching from bulk fertilizers to tablet-based nutrition delivery, with strong emphasis on sustainability metrics and proof points. Primary conversion goals are trial program signups, sample requests, and sales team contact.

## Key Requirements
- Hero section with bold value proposition questioning current farming waste
- Product explanation section covering nano-particle technology ("smaller than a plant cell"), integration benefits, and zero-emission manufacturing
- "How it works" educational content explaining the tablet delivery mechanism and uptake efficiency
- Environmental impact calculator or stats showcase (1000x lighter logistics, ½ ton CO₂e saved per acre, 99% uptake)
- Social proof section for field trials and farmer testimonials
- Active field trials tracker with "next update" countdown or timeline
- Product catalog showcasing multiple CropTab™ variants (NPK, K, N, P, NPK+)
- Secondary product lines navigation (Nutripeak™ Micros, ElevateFeed™ feed additives)
- Multiple conversion paths: eligibility checker, sample request, access request, contact forms
- "Why we share this" transparency/mission statement section
- Science and approach content pages (linked education resources)

## Target Audience
- Commercial farmers and growers looking to reduce input costs while maintaining yields
- Agricultural operations concerned with regulatory compliance around runoff and emissions
- Sustainability-focused farm managers and agribusiness decision-makers
- Early adopter farmers interested in precision agriculture technology
- Agricultural buyers evaluating carbon footprint reduction strategies

## Brand Personality
- Science-backed and data-driven (specific metrics: 99% uptake, ½ ton CO₂e savings)
- Provocative and challenging (questions the status quo with "how much could you grow if nothing was wasted?")
- Transparent and collaborative (openly sharing field trial progress, inviting farmer participation)
- Mission-oriented around environmental impact without sacrificing performance
- Confident but not overselling (acknowledges trial phase, focuses on verifiable benefits)
- Direct and pragmatic communication style appropriate for working farmers

## Specific Requests
- Maintain the contrast between old/wasteful methods and new precision approach
- Preserve the emissions/carbon savings narrative as a core differentiator
- Keep the dual messaging: environmental benefits AND economic efficiency (less input, same yield)
- Maintain visual distinction between product lines (macronutrients, micronutrients, feed additives)
- Preserve the "early access" / exclusivity positioning for trial participants
- Keep the educational linking structure to science and approach pages
- Maintain food safety messaging as a trust signal
- Emphasize the logistics advantage (1000x lighter) as a practical benefit
- Preserve product imagery showing tablet format and labeling

## Technical Notes
- Multiple CTAs pointing to "#" anchor links need functional modal or form implementations
- Eligibility checker requires conditional logic form or quiz functionality
- Field trials section needs CMS capability for regular updates or countdown timer integration
- Product catalog should be modular for easy expansion of variants
- Consider lead capture integration (HubSpot, Salesforce, or similar CRM)
- Forms need to distinguish between sample requests, trial access, and general contact
- Site needs to handle both immediate conversion goals and longer nurture sequences
- Standard Next.js build with performance optimization for data-heavy environmental impact visualizations
- Consider animation/scroll interactions for showing before/after or waste reduction concepts
