# Brief: farm-minerals-v6

## Business
Farm Minerals develops and manufactures advanced agricultural fertilizers using nanotechnology. Their flagship product, CropTab™, is a tablet-based fertilizer delivery system that uses particles smaller than plant cells to maximize nutrient uptake while eliminating runoff and reducing carbon emissions. The company positions itself as an agricultural technology innovator focused on sustainability, combining precision agriculture with environmental responsibility. They're currently in field trial phase and operating on a limited access/sample request model rather than open sales.

## What They Need
A promotional landing page designed to generate qualified leads for their CropTab™ product line during the field trial phase. The site needs to educate farmers and agricultural decision-makers about the revolutionary technology, demonstrate environmental and economic benefits with concrete data, build credibility through field testing transparency, and capture contact information through multiple access request CTAs throughout the page.

## Key Requirements
- Hero section with strong value proposition headline and immediate CTA
- Technology explanation section breaking down the three core innovations (nano-scale particles, effortless integration, zero emissions manufacturing)
- Product showcase featuring multiple CropTab™ variants (NPK, K, N, P, NPK+) with visual product cards
- Data-driven benefits section highlighting specific metrics (1000x lighter logistics, ½ ton CO₂e saved per acre, 99% uptake)
- Field trial transparency section with "next update" timeline and explanation of why trials are being shared publicly
- Social proof section for farmer testimonials and field test results
- Multiple access request forms/modals triggered by CTAs throughout the page
- Product format comparison (Macronutrient vs Micronutrient fertilizers)
- Links to deeper science/approach pages for users who want technical details

## Target Audience
- Commercial row crop farmers and growers looking to reduce input costs while maintaining yields
- Farm managers and agricultural operations directors making purchasing decisions
- Early adopter farmers interested in sustainable agriculture practices
- Agronomists and agricultural consultants evaluating new technologies
- Environmentally-conscious farming operations seeking carbon reduction solutions

## Brand Personality
- Scientifically rigorous but accessible (technical claims backed by data, explained in farmer-friendly language)
- Transparently confident (sharing field trial progress, not hiding that product is still being tested)
- Environmental without being preachy (leading with economic/practical benefits, sustainability as a bonus)
- Precision-focused and data-driven (specific metrics like "½ ton CO₂e" and "99% uptake" rather than vague claims)
- Innovative but grounded (revolutionary technology framed in practical farming terms like "just drop it")

## Specific Requests
- Maintain the question-based headline approach ("How much could you grow — if nothing was wasted?")
- Preserve the visual product card layout showing different CropTab™ formulations with descriptive text
- Keep the three-column benefit breakdown format (lighter logistics / CO₂ saved / uptake percentage)
- Retain the field trial transparency approach with update timeline
- Maintain multiple request access entry points throughout the page flow
- Preserve the technical deep-dive links for users wanting more scientific detail
- Keep the "early access" positioning and scarcity framing ("You don't get many chances to be early")
- Maintain modal/anchor-based CTAs (#) for access requests rather than sending users to separate pages

## Technical Notes
- Next.js build with server-side rendering for SEO
- Modal system for access request forms (multiple CTAs link to #, suggesting modal overlays)
- Need form integration for lead capture (likely connects to CRM or email marketing platform)
- Performance optimization critical given target audience may be on rural internet connections
- Product cards should be component-based for easy addition of new CropTab™ variants as they develop
- Consider implementing a waitlist/early access queue system tied to the request access forms
- Field trial section should be easily updatable as new data comes in
