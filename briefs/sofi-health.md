# Brief: sofi-health

## Business
Sofi Health is a wellness technology company that creates personalized plant-based remedies for sleep and mood improvement. They've developed a connected device ecosystem consisting of a rechargeable "pod" (spray device) that works with interchangeable natural plant capsules (valerian, passiflora, ashwagandha) and a companion smartphone app. The business model combines hardware sales with consumable capsule subscriptions. Their unique value proposition is using data collection and machine learning to measure and personalize the effectiveness of traditional plant remedies for each individual user, tracking results over time to build a "personal playlist" of what works. They position themselves at the intersection of ancient herbal wisdom and modern quantified-self technology.

## What They Need
A product marketing website that serves as the primary digital storefront to educate prospects about the sofi system, demonstrate how the hardware-software-consumables ecosystem works together, build credibility for their data-driven approach to plant medicine, and drive conversions to their e-commerce shop. The site needs to explain a relatively complex three-part product system (pod + capsules + app) in an approachable, visually compelling way that doesn't overwhelm users with technical details while still establishing scientific legitimacy.

## Key Requirements
- Hero section with brand tagline and clear product value proposition focused on feeling better and sleep improvement
- Product showcase section for the sofi pod with key features: battery life (week-long, USB-C charging), portability with lock technology, Bluetooth connectivity, color options (brushed aluminum slate and glossy white)
- Capsule library section highlighting current formulations (valerian, passiflora, ashwagandha) with individual product cards and ability to expand as new plants are added seasonally
- Explanation of two product types: ingestible plant remedies (10-day impact timeline) and instant-activation functional fragrances
- Data/science credibility section with specific metrics (2.12x sleep improvement statistic, 37 as key number)
- How-it-works explanation of the measurement and personalization system: pod generates signals with each spray, app analyzes data, system identifies what works for individual users
- Scientific credibility messaging: peer-reviewed research, collaboration with herbalists/conservationists/botanic gardens, sustainability focus
- App features overview: mood and sleep journaling, plant discovery tracking, community access, team support, results dashboard
- Pioneer program mention with link for early access to new formulations
- Clear CTAs to e-commerce shop (separate domain: sofi.health)
- Mobile app availability for iOS and Android

## Target Audience
- Health-conscious millennials and Gen Z consumers (25-40) interested in natural wellness alternatives to pharmaceuticals
- Quantified-self enthusiasts who track sleep, mood, and wellness metrics
- Early adopters comfortable with connected health devices and subscription models
- Urban professionals dealing with stress, sleep issues, or anxiety who prefer natural remedies
- People who've tried traditional supplements but want more personalized, data-driven approaches
- Consumers who value design aesthetics and premium product experiences in the wellness space

## Brand Personality
- Minimalist and sophisticated – clean design language, simple product naming, focus on essential information
- Science-forward but accessible – balances data/metrics with human-centered benefits language
- Quietly confident – uses specific claims ("2.12x improvement") without hype or aggressive marketing
- Nature-meets-technology – honors "thousands of years" of plant wisdom while emphasizing digital innovation
- Personal and supportive – language like "we work together," "helping you discover," emphasis on individual responses
- Premium but approachable – design-conscious product (color choices, aluminum/glossy finishes) without pretension

## Specific Requests
- Maintain the simple, lowercase brand name treatment "sofi" throughout
- Preserve the distinctive "feelbetter" as single word in hero
- Keep the minimalist product photography style showing devices and capsules against clean backgrounds
- Maintain the dual-format content approach: short punchy headlines paired with longer explanatory body text
- Preserve the progression from product (pod) → consumables (capsules) → intelligence (app/data) in site flow
- Keep the iPhone mockups showing the app interface to demonstrate the digital experience
- Maintain focus on specific plant names and their individual properties rather than generic "wellness" language
- Preserve the scientific credibility elements (paper reviews, conservation partnerships, botanic garden collaborations)
- Keep the seasonal release cycle messaging and pioneer program enrollment pathway
- Maintain distinction between the .com brand/education site and .health e-commerce domain

## Technical Notes
- Standard Next.js build with TypeScript
- Needs seamless navigation/handoff to separate e-commerce domain (sofi.health) for shop CTAs
- Bluetooth and mobile app connectivity should be clearly explained without requiring technical documentation
- Image optimization critical – heavy use of product photography throughout
- Cookie consent modal required (already implemented with granular accept/reject options)
- Mobile-first responsive design essential given target audience and app-centric product experience
- Consider subtle scroll animations to reveal product features progressively (suggested by current layout structure)
- Analytics integration needed to track shop CTA conversion rates from marketing site
- Fast loading performance critical for premium brand perception
- Android and iOS app store links/badges needed in app section
