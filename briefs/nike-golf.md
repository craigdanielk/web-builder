# Brief: Nike Golf

## Business
Nike Golf is the golf division of Nike, Inc. — a global athletic brand. This is a golf category marketing landing page inspired by Nike's Swiss e-commerce site (nike.com/ch/en/w/golf-23q9w). Nike Golf designs premium golf apparel, footwear, and accessories combining cutting-edge athletic technology with modern design. Endorsed by elite tour professionals. Available globally through nike.com and retail partners.

## What They Need
A high-impact golf category landing page that showcases Nike's golf product lineup. The page should drive product discovery across categories (shoes, apparel, accessories) while reinforcing Nike's brand identity of innovation, performance, and minimalist design. Marketing-first showcase page, not a full e-commerce PLP.

## Key Requirements

- Social proof from tour professionals and athlete endorsements
- Stats/metrics section with performance data
- Strong CTA driving to the full Nike Golf collection
- Community discount / membership callout

## Target Audience
- Golf enthusiasts who want performance gear that looks good
- Weekend golfers who care about style and brand

- Both male and female golfers across skill levels

## Brand Personality
- Bold, confident, minimalist
- Premium but accessible
- Performance-driven with athlete validation
- Clean, modern, light aesthetic with strong black accents

## Specific Requests
- Light/white background with black text and black accent buttons (matches actual Nike site)
- Nike's signature typography feel — clean geometric sans-serif, uppercase headings

- Stats section with animated counters (tour wins, athlete endorsements, countries)
