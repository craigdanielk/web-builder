# Brief: turm-kaffee-v3

## Business
Turm Kaffee is a traditional Swiss coffee roaster and tea merchant with 260 years of heritage (founded 1761), based in St. Gallen, Switzerland. They specialize in small-batch, artisan coffee roasting using traditional drum roasters at approximately 200°C for 16-20 minutes. The company operates as Turm E-Commerce AG and positions itself as a premium coffee brand combining centuries-old Swiss craftsmanship with modern lifestyle needs. They also run a Barista Academy offering practical training for beginners and coffee enthusiasts.

## What They Need
An e-commerce website that showcases their premium coffee and tea products while communicating their rich heritage and artisanal roasting process. The site needs to balance traditional craftsmanship messaging with modern online shopping functionality, support weekly promotional offers, and facilitate customer engagement through their Barista Academy and newsletter.

## Key Requirements
- E-commerce functionality with shopping cart and product collections (coffee beans, ground coffee, capsules, specialty coffees, tea pyramid bags)
- Product categorization by type (beans, ground, capsules, specialties) and brewing method
- Equipment/machines shop section (coffee machines, filter methods, coffee grinders)
- Weekly offers/promotions section with time-limited deals
- Barista Academy information and contact point
- Newsletter signup with checkbox consent for marketing communications
- Multi-language support (currently German, with English elements visible in code)
- Contact information prominently displayed (phone: +41 71 221 20 60, email: info@turm-ecommerce.ch)
- Certification and association membership badges/logos display
- Company history and roasting process storytelling sections

## Target Audience
- Coffee enthusiasts seeking premium, artisanally-roasted coffee
- Swiss and German-speaking customers who value tradition and quality craftsmanship
- Home baristas and specialty coffee drinkers interested in whole beans and ground coffee
- Tea drinkers looking for quality pyramid tea bags
- Businesses or individuals interested in professional barista training
- Customers aged 30-60 who appreciate heritage brands and are willing to pay premium prices for quality

## Brand Personality
- Heritage-focused and traditional (emphasizing 260 years of experience)
- Artisanal and craftsmanship-oriented (small batch roasting, precision manufacturing)
- Swiss precision and quality standards
- Warm and approachable (inviting customers to "master the art of coffee")
- Educational and expert (offering barista training, detailed roasting process information)
- Modern yet timeless (balancing tradition with contemporary lifestyle)

## Specific Requests
- Preserve the emphasis on the 260-year heritage as a key differentiator
- Maintain detailed storytelling about the roasting process (drum roaster, temperature, timing, small batches)
- Keep the three-pillar content approach: precision manufacturing, fresh roasting for exceptional taste, and elevating daily coffee moments
- Include prominent certification and association membership section
- Preserve the contrast between industrial roasting processes and their artisanal approach
- Maintain the "Turm Kaffee makes coffee an experience" messaging
- Keep the focus on trusted growing regions and carefully selected beans
- The smoothie offers in the current content appear to be placeholder/demo content and should be removed in favor of actual coffee/tea products

## Technical Notes
- Platform: Shopify (current site is Shopify-based, evident from cart structure and class names)
- Fix the H1 heading which currently contains CSS code instead of proper content
- Implement proper heading hierarchy (broken CSS in H1 tag needs correction)
- Swiss-based hosting recommended for local market performance
- Support for Swiss payment methods (TWINT, PostFinance, etc.)
- Multi-language architecture (DE primary, potential for FR/IT/EN)
- Newsletter integration with consent management (GDPR/Swiss data protection compliance)
